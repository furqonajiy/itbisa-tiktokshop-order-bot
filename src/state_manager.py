"""
state_manager.py
----------------
Loads and saves the JSON file that remembers which packages we already processed.

Why this file exists:
  Every GitHub Actions run starts on a fresh machine with no memory of previous
  runs. To avoid sending the same shipping label twice, we save a small JSON
  file that maps each processed package_id to the timestamp when we processed it.
  This file is committed back to the repo at the end of each successful run.

The file format looks like this:
  {
    "PACKAGE_ABC123": "2026-04-18T10:00:00+00:00",
    "PACKAGE_XYZ789": "2026-04-18T11:00:00+00:00"
  }
