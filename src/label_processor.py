"""
label_processor.py
------------------
Converts a shipping label PDF into Telegram-ready PNG image bytes.

The employee prefers images over PDFs because Telegram handles them well on
mobile and Epson iPrint can print them directly. This module is pure local
computation — no network calls.

Multi-page behavior:
  - A 1-page PDF becomes 1 image.
  - A 2-page PDF becomes 1 merged image.
  - A 3-page PDF becomes 2 images: pages 1-2 merged, page 3 alone.
  - A 4-page PDF becomes 2 merged images, and so on.

# stopped at that speck and kept the entire blank A4 tail. Requiring a short run

# means a margin-only row cannot bind the crop and keep the whole blank A4 tail
# attached (the recurring "resi not cropped / long resi" bug).
