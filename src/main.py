"""
main.py
-------
The entry point. Run this file to do one full processing cycle.

What this script does, in order:
  1. Load the list of order IDs we already processed.
  2. Ask Shopee for orders in READY_TO_SHIP or PROCESSED status.
  3. Filter out the ones we already handled.
  4. Stop if there are too many (safety check).
  5. For each new order:
     a. If READY_TO_SHIP, call ship_order_to_dropoff to arrange shipment
        (equivalent to clicking "Atur Pengiriman" -> "Antar ke Counter"
        in the Shopee Seller app). This moves the order to PROCESSED.
     b. Fetch the shipping label PDF (with retries while Shopee generates it).
     c. Convert PDF to PNG, send to Telegram, mark as processed only AFTER
        Telegram confirms delivery.
  6. Save the updated state file so future runs remember.
  7. Send a heartbeat summary to Telegram so the employee knows the bot
     is alive, even if there were no orders this run.

The GitHub Actions workflow runs this script on a schedule.
