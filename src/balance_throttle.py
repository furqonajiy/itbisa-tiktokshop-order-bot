balance_throttle.py
-------------------
Tracks this order bot's `/stock_balance` dispatches and guarantees no touched
SKU is ever dropped. `MIN_INTERVAL_HOURS` is the minimum spacing between
dispatches: it caps balance to one workflow run per window to conserve GitHub
Actions minutes. With the current 1-hour window, a burst of order runs in the
same hour produces a single balance run instead of one per run. Set it to 0 to
dispatch on every run (immediate rebalance, most Actions minutes); raise it to
trade rebalance freshness for fewer runs.

Because packages are marked processed as soon as their labels are delivered, any
run that withholds its balance dispatch — the throttle window, or a failed
dispatch — would otherwise lose the SKUs it touched (the next run won't re-see
those packages). To avoid that, the base SKUs touched while a dispatch is
withheld are accumulated in `pending_skus` and flushed in a single dispatch once
the window reopens. `/stock_balance` is idempotent (it re-reads current stock
and re-splits), so deferring is safe.

State lives in `data/balance_throttle.json` on the `bot-state` branch:
  {"last_dispatch_at": "<iso-utc>" | null, "pending_skus": ["BASE-SKU", ...]}

Duplicated across both order bots on purpose (self-contained repos); do not
factor it out.
