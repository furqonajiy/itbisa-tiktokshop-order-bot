"""
balance_throttle.py
-------------------
Tracks this order bot's `/stock_balance` dispatches and guarantees no touched
SKU is ever dropped. `MIN_INTERVAL_HOURS` is the minimum spacing between
dispatches; with `MIN_INTERVAL_HOURS = 0` the bot dispatches on every run that
ships something, so a platform that just sold down is rebalanced immediately
instead of waiting for a window to reopen (no stock stranded on one platform).

Because packages are marked processed as soon as their labels are delivered, any
run that withholds its balance dispatch — a positive interval, or a failed
dispatch — would otherwise lose the SKUs it touched (the next run won't re-see
those packages). To avoid that, the base SKUs touched while a dispatch is
withheld are accumulated in `pending_skus` and flushed in a single dispatch on
the next run. `/stock_balance` is idempotent (it re-reads current stock and
re-splits), so deferring is safe.

State lives in `data/balance_throttle.json` on the `bot-state` branch:
  {"last_dispatch_at": "<iso-utc>" | null, "pending_skus": ["BASE-SKU", ...]}

Duplicated across both order bots on purpose (self-contained repos); do not
factor it out.
