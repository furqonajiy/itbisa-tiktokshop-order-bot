shopee_auth.py
--------------
Manages the Shopee access_token and refresh_token lifecycle.

Why this file exists:
  Shopee tokens expire on a schedule:
    - access_token: valid for 4 hours
    - refresh_token: valid for 30 days

  Since the bot runs every hour, the access_token will always need refreshing
  on most runs. This module handles that transparently: callers just ask for
  "a valid access token" and this module takes care of checking expiry,
  refreshing if needed, and saving the updated tokens back to disk.

  Tokens are stored in data/shopee_tokens.json, which is committed back to
  the repo at the end of each run (same pattern as processed_orders.json).

Public functions (used by shopee_client.py):
  - get_valid_access_token() -> string (an access token known to be fresh)

When refresh_token itself expires (every 30 days):
  The refresh call will fail with an error from Shopee. This module raises
  RefreshTokenExpiredError, which main.py catches and reports via Telegram
  so the shop owner can manually re-authorize through the Shopee Console.
