"""
shopee_client.py
----------------
Talks to the Shopee Open API.

Why this file exists:
  Shopee requires every API call to be signed with HMAC-SHA256 using your
  partner key. The signing rules are specific and easy to get wrong, so we
  isolate all that logic here. The rest of the code does not need to know
  anything about HMAC, base URLs, or Shopee's quirks.

Public functions (used by main.py):
  - get_pending_orders() -> list of order dicts (READY_TO_SHIP + PROCESSED)
  - ship_order_to_dropoff(order_sn) -> None (raises on error)
  - get_shipping_label_pdf(order_sn) -> bytes (or None if not ready yet)

Fake mode:
  When config.USE_FAKE_SHOPEE is True, the public functions below delegate
  to shopee_client_fake instead of calling the real Shopee API. This is
  used during local development when sandbox access is not available.
  To remove fake mode entirely, delete shopee_client_fake.py and remove
  the if-blocks at the top of each public function below.
